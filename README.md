A simple and reliable GPS tracker with LoraWan boards

# Description
The transmitter uses a simple GPS module and has about 30 hours of battery life. The receiver includes a “find” button that activates a small buzzer and permanently stores the last known location from the most recent communication.
It’s very useful for locating an airplane without relying on GSM. I know there are plenty of commercial solutions out there, but this one perfectly covers our needs in case of loss.

# Target Frames  
fpv planes, drones, cars
