# Gps-tracker
A simple and reliable GPS tracker with LoraWan boards.

# Description
The transmitter uses a simple GPS module and has about 30 hours of battery life. The receiver includes a ‚Äúfind‚Äù button that activates a small buzzer and permanently stores the last known location from the most recent communication.
It‚Äôs very useful for locating an airplane without relying on GSM. I know there are plenty of commercial solutions out there, but this one perfectly covers our needs in case of loss.

# Target Frames  
fpv planes, drones, cars 

# üîß Hardware Needed
1. Lora 32 - V3 (heltec Board) X2 .
2. Any GPS module with Nmea protocol.
3. A single Buzzer.
4. A lipo battery 1 cell (1000 up to 2000 mah).
5. A plastic case.
